You can leave the default options and just press enter if you are ok with them

First I need to know the IPv4 address of the network interface you want OpenVPN
listening to.

   1) UDP (recommended)
   2) TCP
Protocol [1-2]: 1

What port do you want OpenVPN listening to?
Port: 1194

Which DNS do you want to use with the VPN?
   1) Current system resolvers
   2) Google
   3) OpenDNS
   4) NTT

Finally, tell me your name for the client certificate
Please, use one word only, no special characters
